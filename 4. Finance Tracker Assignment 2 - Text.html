<p>ASSIGNMENT:</p>

<p>1. Create a github repository for your finance-tracker app in your github account (now you should have two github repositories, 1 for alpha-blog and 1 for finance-tracker in your github profile)</p>



<p>2. Push your code to your github repository so it's saved</p>



<p>3. Re-organize your gemfile to put sqlite3 gem in group development, test and create a group for production</p>



<p>4. In your production group add in gem pg (postgres) and rails_12factor to make your app heroku ready. If using Rails 5: you only need to add gem 'pg' in your production group, you don't need to add gem 'rails_12factor'. Note:&nbsp;You may need to specify the pg gem version like this in your gemfile group production:&nbsp;gem 'pg', '~&gt; 0.11'</p>



<p>5. Run bundle install --without production to update your .gemfile.lock file </p>



<p>6. Create a welcome controller, a root route for welcome#index, an index action in your welcome_controller.rb file (should be empty at this time)</p>



<p>7. Create a welcome folder under your app/views/ folder and within the folder create an index.html.erb file and fill it in with &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the finance tracker app&lt;/h1&gt;</p>



<p>8. Preview your app and ensure it goes to this page in local development</p>



<p>9. Commit your code to your git repo</p>



<p>10. Push your code to your github repo</p>



<p>11. Create a heroku app for your application (you can reference steps taken during the alpha-blog, ensure you do this from your finance-tracker app folder)</p>



<p>12. Rename the heroku app to something more friendly and reasonable</p>



<p>13. Deploy your code to your heroku app and ensure you are able to preview the app and it takes you to the "Welcome to the finance tracker app" page</p>



<p>14. Post a link to your heroku app page in the discussions</p>



<p>15. IMPORTANT: Don't proceed to the next video unless you're able to get the above working. It is necessary that you are able to perform the tasks above and the videos going forward will make this assumption (You can reference the alpha-blog videos for help at any time). If you want to skip production deploy with heroku, then you can skip those steps, but you have to atleast get a github repository  and working root route/view working.</p>
